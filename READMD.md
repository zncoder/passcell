PassCell is a Firefox/Chrome extension that manages passwords of
sites. 

It features end-to-end encryption of the site passwords. The site
passwords are encrypted with your master password and then stored in
the browser and in the server as well for retrieval from other
devices. The master password never leaves the local browser.
